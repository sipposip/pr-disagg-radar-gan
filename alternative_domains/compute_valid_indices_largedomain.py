"""

read in formatted data (outut from reformat_data.py),
and determined all valid training samples from it.

valid training samples are all ndomain x ndomain boxes that are free of NaN values,
and where the daily sum exceeds a certain threshold at at least a certain amount of points
(default 5mm on 20 points on a 16x16 domain)

the "sweep" over the domain is controlled by the "stride" parameter. If it is 1, then all possible boxes
are tried out (including those with overlap). with strid=ndomain, all non-overlapping boxes are scanned.

output: .pkl file containing the indices of the training samples

these indices can then be used the following way:
idcs = final_valid_idcs[0]
sub = data[idcs[0],:,idcs[1]:idcs[1]+ndomain,idcs[2]:idcs[2]+ndomain]

@internal: run on misu160 and kebnekaise
